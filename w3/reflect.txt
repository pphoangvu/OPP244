1) How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? Why?
There are 40 elements that store a family name or given name for the account but not 41 like in C program. The reason is that C++ automatically adds a null terminator to the end of the string for us (we don’t need to include it ourselves).

2) Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  In C, this would generate an error.  Name the feature of C++ that allows this.
Because in C it requires a unique name for each function while in C++ the function overloading feature allows us to overload the name as well as one name function can do many things without thinking about another name.

3) What have you learned during this workshop?
I learned how to cast a number by using abs as well as declare a class, function members.
